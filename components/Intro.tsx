            React Typescript Loaders is a nice, simple package for your React
            applications. Out of the box, with no extra configuration, you get a
            default spinner that uses the foreground colour for the element you
            place it in.
         </p>

         <p>
            Want to change the colour? How about a duotone loader? Change the
            size? All are really easy to do and are fully typed.
         </p>
      </div>
   )
}

export default Intro
